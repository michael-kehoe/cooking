* 2 Tablespoons Butter melted
* 3/4 Cup Whole Milk
* 2 Teaspoons Vanilla
* 1 Dash Cinnamon optional
* 1 Dash Nutmeg optional
* 2 Tablespoons Sugar

## Steps
1. Beat the egg in a baking dish or pie plate.
2. Whisk in the melted butter, then slowly add the milk and vanilla, whisking to combine.
3. Add the sugar and flour while continuing to whisk until totally smooth.
4. Soak each side of the bread in the batter for about 15-20 seconds.
5. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and spread butter all over the bottom. I just hold a stick and rub it everywhere.

7. Serve with buttermilk syrup or any favorite syrup!
