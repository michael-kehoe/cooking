# Steps
1. Pan fry/cook anything that takes more than a minute to cook. I pan fried tofu, mushrooms and broccoli. I salted everything while pan frying.
2. Heat up canola oil, then drop in aromatics. Chopped onions and minced garlic is a must. I also added mined garlic. Cook until the onions are translucent.
3. Drop in some finely chopped veggies. I used the frozen stuff. Heat all the way through, maybe a minute.
4. Make some space in the middle of the wok/pan and pour in some beaten egg. My partner is vegan, so I used Just Egg. Cook for about a minute.
5. Drop in stale rice and fry for another minute or so. Coat with soy sauce and mix in until the rice is fully coated.
6. Drop in any pre-cooked ingredients (tofu, etc.) and mix to combine.
7. Season to taste (salt, pepper, MSG, etc.). Mix in some sesame oil and serve. (edited)
